### Interests
I am interested in _recording_, _understanding_ and _simulating_ the natural world around us. I explore these interests through:
* [**Photography**](https://manas96.github.io/photography/):  A means for me to record and comprehend natural phenomena, while also delving into the nuances of camera technology. I am intrigued by the challenges that come with exploring the limits of consumer-level budget cameras.
* **Outdoor adventures**: I enjoy hiking and biking. I feel most alive after overcoming difficult physical challenges and being rewarded with a breathtaking view.
* **Researching simulation techniques**: My work in Computer Graphics focuses on researching simulation techniques that allow me to form mathematical models of our world. I am interested in _all_ physics simulation techniques - from physically based animation to path tracing. I enjoy the process of designing algorithms, implementing them in software, and optimizing their performance.

### Current
* Master's thesis student at the [McGill School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) in Montreal, Canada. I am supervised by [Prof. Paul Kry](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/).

* Research intern at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home), working on distributed physics processing.

### Previous
* Data scientist at [Infinite Uptime](https://www.infinite-uptime.com/), a startup that manufactures sensor devices to predict machine health for large-scale industrial motors (think Fitbits for large machines). I worked across the software stack - from embedded C++ firmware programming to designing & implementing a data ingenstion pipeline for 8k+ devices to implementing data science/ML algorithms. My work also led to a patent application in the Indian patent office.

* Associate full stack software engineer at [NICE](https://www.nice.com/).

* Contributed to the book series [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html#acknowledgments).
