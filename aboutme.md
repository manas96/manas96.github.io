## TL;DR: 
##### In a hurry? Read this section

My name is Manas Kale. I currently live in **Pune, India**. I have a **Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science)** degree from [Maharashtra Institute of Technology, Pune](http://www.mitpune.com/). I like **learning** & writing code, photography, games, Formula 1, **space** and exploring the interwebs.

##### Got a few minutes? Great! Bot or not, I appreciate your time.
A few reasons ***why*** I like some of the things listed above:
* ***Learning***:  The feeling of getting to know something that I didn't know before is one of the most gratifying feelings I get everyday. I frequently go down Wikipedia rabbit holes or reddit and read about things which I never knew existed. I like learning technical details of anything I come across.

* ***Formula 1***: I appreciate the delicate interplay of a driver's skill & endurance, engineering a fast car, managing tyre health and having a racing strategy that are required to win a single Grand Prix. It's sad we can't hear the old [V12 engines roaring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNjDwoEnXqE)  or hear the [V10 engines screaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywPoevd1t2g) today. Currently, F1 cars use hybrid engines with energy recovery systems. The [FIA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l'Automobile) hope is that F1 innovations in this eco-friendly technology will trickle down to consumer car markets. That's something we can all get behind :)

<!-- TODO blog post about engine -->
* ***Games***: Apart from the art aspects of games(visuals, music, storytelling, dialogue), I am fascinated by the mathematics and logic that goes into rendering a 3d world and simulate lighting. I was quiet disappointed when this was not taught in my Engineering curriculum. So I tried going through Unreal Engine 4's [source code](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine). And I did not understand more than 10 consecutive lines. I was delighted because this gave me an excuse to attempt to create my own rendering engine from scratch. After a few months of persistance, many tutorials and an OpenGL handbook I made a [3D renderer](3drenderer.md) using OpenGL. I still don't understand UE4's source however. The quest continues.

* ***Space***: The cosmos both humbles and inspires me. That our whole world is a [Pale Blue Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) is humbling. Despite our insignificance, having reached [beyond our solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1) is inspiring. I'll be able to witness event(s) as groundbreaking as Apollo 11 in my lifetime.

I am a typist. On this [typing test](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english), I had an average score of 77 words per minute which falls in the [top 10 percentile](img/typing.png) of the website's users. I had no formal typing lessons, I learnt typing simply by spending a lot of time in front of a keyboard since highschool(playing World of Warcraft mostly) and always trying to improve.

My [Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) is [INFJ(Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judging)](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-strengths-and-weaknesses). While I agree that a 10 minute quiz is not enough to describe a person, I think many of the strengths and almost all of the weaknesses listed on the website are accurate.
