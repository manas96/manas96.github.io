I explore these interests through:\nPhotography: I like recording and understanding natural phenomena (TODO LINK). At the same time, I am fascinated by how current camera technology works and enjoy exploring the limits of consumer-level budget cameras. Outdoor adventures: I enjoy hiking and biking. I feel most alive after overcoming difficult physical challenges. Researching simulation techniques: I work in Computer Graphics. I am interested in all physics simulation techniques - from physically based animation to path tracing. I enjoy the challenge of creating mathematical models to describe reality, designing algorithms, and implementing and optimizing them in software. Currently, I am a Master\u0026rsquo;s student at the McGill School of Computer Science in Montreal, Canada. I am supervised by Prof. Paul Kry.\nI am also a research intern at Huawei Noah\u0026rsquo;s Ark Lab, working on distributed physics processing.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my CV.\nI am always keen about going on nature expeditions to document flora and fauna. Feel free to get in touch if interested.\n","href":"/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"Enabling Archive For enabling Archive, add the following frontmatter in your content file:\ntype: page layout: archive ","href":"/photography/","title":"Photography"},{"content":"","href":"/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/config/","title":"Configuration"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/og/","title":"Opengraph"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"}]
