title: Multimodal emotion recognition
subtitle: Real time emotion recognition using multiple inputs inputs - text, tone and video
---
We implemented a novel method to combine emotions recognized by 3 different modules : a text module that uses spoken English words as input, a tone module that uses physical characteristics of speech and a video module that uses facial expressions. Weighted outputs from each of these were combined to determine a final emotion. These weights were dynamically adjusted based on the quality of input and confidence score of each module.
